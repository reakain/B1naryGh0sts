There's something in your data... For NaNoGenMo 2020

It was only a month ago I trawled through all the sad mecha table top rpg game entires for a sad mech game jam on itch, so I'm gonna see what I can do to with parsing and text injection to make a story that at least starts out fairly straightforward, but... eventually have some digital ghosts or echoes or memories start making noise in the text, and see what it comes up with.

Here's hoping I can even find some time to spend on this ;0;
